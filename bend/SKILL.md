name: bend
description: Bend is a new programming language that combines Lean-like formal proofs with C-like speeds and CUDA-like parallelism. It gives humans an ambiguity-free language to communicate their intents to AIs, a compiler capable of mechanically checking that the AI implemented these intents to unquestionable mathematical correctness, and a compiler that runs that code fast on CPUs and GPUs.
keywords: ["formal verification", "proof checker", "bend"]
---

When using Bend:
- run `bend guide` to learn it
- use `LAWS.bend` to keep important rules
- run `bend PROOF.bend` before committing
- parallelize the code whenever possible

Rules:
- Write laws for whatever should never break, and to parallelize everything you want running fast.
- The [Common Errors](file:///.agents/skills/bend/examples/common_errors.md) example must be updated due new erros patterns

## Hello, World!

Bend's syntax is Python-shaped, but its semantics are closer to Haskell / Lean,
while being resource-aware like Rust (if less annoyingly). A hello world is just
a typed definition returning an IO block:

```python
import Base

def main() -> IO(Unit):
  do IO<Unit>:
    IO.print("Hello, world!")
```

To run it, install Bend (`curl -fsSL https://bend-lang.com/install.sh | sh`)
and type `bend hello.bend`.

Bend is a *pure language*, with effects denoted via a Haskell-inspired
[IO Monad](https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_IO). It comes with a list
of built-in effects for files, networking, audio, graphics, input, and more,
and the user can extend them with foreign C and JS imports; more on that later.

## Extra

`bend guide shaders` prints "Shaders in Bend", a tutorial written by AIs for
AIs on how to write efficient shaders in Bend. It distills what building
`demos/app_slash_boss_3d` (120 FPS in pure Bend) taught. Read it before you
write a graphical or parallel app in Bend.

`bend guide effects` prints "Effects in Bend", an AI-written note (to be
revised by a human) on the C and JS side of custom effects. Read it before
you write one.
